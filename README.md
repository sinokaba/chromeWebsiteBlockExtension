# chromeWebsiteBlockExtension

This app uses chrome extension api to communicate with the chrome browser and intercept the websites the user is attempting to access. If the website is in the block or permaban list the website will not be loaded. Although there are extensions out there already similar to this in the google chrome store, I still chose to pursue this project because I thought it would be fun, and I want to improve my skills. This extension is still a work in progress and has not been publish in the google chrome store.



#features planned on being added in the future:

1. ask and require user password for when removing blocked websites
2. about/info tab
3. increase number of individual sites blockable
4. ask user why they are blocking that specific site
5. use api or something to search each site being entered and see if they exist, if they don't alert the user
6. list sites frequently visited by the user, to give them an idea if they want to ban them
7. list frequently banned sites
8. ask user for how long a site should be banned for - requires password
9. rework UI to make it more aesthetically pleasing to the eye
