# chromeWebsiteBlockExtension

This app uses chrome extension api to communicate with the chrome browser and intercept the websites the user is attempting to access. If the website is in the block or permaban list the website will not be loaded. Although there are extensions out there already similar to this in the google chrome store, I still chose to pursue this project because I thought it would be fun, and I wanted to improve my skills. This extension is still a work in progress and has not been publish in the google chrome store.
