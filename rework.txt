chrome extension outline:

1. user fill outs input fields, then clicks block
2. js detects that the button has been clicked and grabs the information inputted
3. js sends the background.js the info that it has obtained
4. background received the message, stores it, then calls the block function
5. add get url and comments function in background, have js call it
6. popup.js gets the items it requests and prints it out on the popup.html

countdown timer functionality:

1) user chooses unit of time, min/hour/day, and the amount of time
2) clicks block with url filled out
3) popup.js sends message to background about url, time, time unit and function
4) background.js starts the countdown timer, adds url to blocklist

*most likely cannot continously send updated timer from background to popup using chrome send message
might have to just show static text, such as "banned for: 5 min", no countdown


**NEED to set block counter using cookies, the counter in background.js disappears after session ends
or when user closes browser
